# spotify_data_analysis
Some analysis on personal Spotify Data listening habits.

Spotify allows you to order your personal listening data; navigate to your Spotify account dashboard (https://www.spotify.com/us/account/overview/), go to your Privacy settings and to the download your data section and request the data. It says this will take up to 30 days, but normally takes 4-5. This data includes your account details amongst other things, but most importantly your streaming history from the last 12 months.

This code reads in your streaming history and analyses it to generate a bunch of insights about your listening history from the last 12 months. Since a lot of the analysis done is month dependent and was developed in Dec 2021 - Jan 2022, it is restricted to only look at your 2021 data. However this can be changed in the future.

This has some real people's data analysis, so please treat it with respect!
